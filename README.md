 Project Type:*  
  Data Science / Machine Learning Project

   Project Topic:*  
  Predictive Analysis of Patient Readmission in Diabetes Care

 Domain:*  
  Healthcare / Medical Data Analytics

 Objective:*  
  To analyze diabetic patient data and build a model that can *predict the likelihood of hospital readmission* based on patient history, medication, and demographic factors.


    Dataset Link:*  
 public dataset for reference: (diabetic_data.csv)
  [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Diabetes 130-US hospitals](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

 Target Variable:*  
  readmitted  
  (This column shows whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days, after 30 days, or not at all)

   Learner Comments:*  
This project helps in understanding *feature selection, **class imbalance, and **healthcare ML applications*.  
Real-world dataset with missing and inconsistent values – good for learning data cleaning.  
Ideal for practicing classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.  
Can explore model interpretability using SHAP or feature importance tools.  
Great for building a full ML pipeline (data cleaning → modeling → evaluation → deployment).
